# MXene–Hydroxyapatite–Silver Composite for Bone Regeneration and Wound Healing

This mini project aimed to develop a biomedical composite using MXene, Hydroxyapatite, and Silver, with enhanced biocompatibility, antibacterial performance, and mechanical strength.

## ⚙️ Objectives
- Combine MXene conductivity with HAP biocompatibility and Ag’s antibacterial action
- Evaluate the composite’s mechanical strength and biological compatibility

## 🔬 Methods
- Composite Synthesis
- Antibacterial and Mechanical Testing
- Biocompatibility Assessment

## 🧠 Outcomes
- Proposed as an advanced biomaterial for bone implants and wound dressings
- Benchmarked against standard biomaterials for medical-grade use

## 🧪 Tools & Concepts
MXene | HAP | Ag Nanoparticles | Antibacterial Testing | Cell Culture Studies
